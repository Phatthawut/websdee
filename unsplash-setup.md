## üéØ What You Get

## üìã Prerequisites

1. An Unsplash account (free)
2. Your Vue.js application with admin panel

## üöÄ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Unsplash Developer Account

1. Go to [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
2. Sign up or log in to your Unsplash account
3. Click "Register as a developer"
4. Accept the developer terms

### Step 2: Create a New Application

1. Go to [Your Apps](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications)
2. Click "New Application"
3. Fill out the application form:
   - **Application name**: WebsDee Blog (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: Blog article image management system
   - **Website**: Your website URL
   - **Additional information**: Used for selecting featured images for blog articles
4. Accept the terms and click "Create application"

### Step 3: Get Your Access Key

1. After creating the application, you'll see your app details
2. Copy the **Access Key** (NOT the Secret Key)
3. Keep this key secure - you'll need it for the environment variables

### Step 4: Add Environment Variable

Add the following to your `.env` file (create one if it doesn't exist):

```env
# Unsplash API Configuration
VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
```

Replace `your_access_key_here` with the Access Key you copied from step 3.

### Step 5: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Create or edit an article
3. Look for the "Featured Image" section

6. Click on any photo to select it

## üì∏ How It Works

2. **Search**: Search for specific topics or browse featured photos

## üîí Legal & Compliance

### What's Allowed

- ‚úÖ Use photos for commercial purposes
- ‚úÖ Use photos for blog articles
- ‚úÖ Modify and edit photos
- ‚úÖ Use photos without attribution (though appreciated)

### What's Not Allowed

- ‚ùå Don't sell unedited photos as standalone products
- ‚ùå Don't create competing photo platforms
- ‚ùå Don't use photos for harmful or illegal content

### Best Practices

- Include photographer attribution when possible
- Follow Unsplash community guidelines
- Respect the API rate limits
- Use appropriate search terms

## üõ† Customization Options

### Search Categories

You can modify the quick search categories in `UnsplashImagePicker.vue`:

```javascript
const quickCategories = [
  "business",
  "technology",
  "design",
  "office",
  "computer",
  "marketing",
  "workspace",
];
```

### Photos Per Page

The integration loads 12 photos initially and 12 more with each "Load More" click. You can modify this in `UnsplashImagePicker.vue`:

```javascript
const photosPerPage = 12; // Change this number to load more/fewer photos
```

### Image Sizes

The integration uses `regular` size by default (1080px width). You can change this in the `selectPhoto` function:

```javascript
// Available sizes: raw, full, regular, small, thumb
url: photo.urls.regular;
```

### Attribution Display

Attribution is stored with each article and can be displayed in your blog posts:

```vue
<div v-if="article.imageAttribution" class="text-sm text-gray-500">
  <span v-html="article.imageAttribution"></span>
</div>
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Unsplash access key is required" error**

- Check that `VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
- Restart your development server after adding the key
- Ensure there are no extra spaces around the key

**API rate limit exceeded**

- Free tier allows 50 requests/hour
- Consider caching popular searches
- For higher limits, apply for production access on Unsplash

**Images not loading**
